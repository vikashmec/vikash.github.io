## Work Experience
### Tredence Analytics Private Limited (June 2021 - Present)
#### Customer Insights and Strategic
- Engineered and automated data pipelines using PySpark, Python, and Airflow; extracted data from multiple sources and transformed into final tables in Hive and Postgres, reducing manual processing time by 50%.
- Implemented a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) methodology and executed Lift Analysis, quantified gift card impact, revealing that gift card customers spend 40% more than non-gift card customers.
- Performed an overlap analysis on Rx store and Rx OPD transactions, followed by a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to understand the low (1-2%) overlap between these two customer segments.
- Analyzed footfall data for categorizing stores based on prospective sales opportunity of health insurance, also identifying top 5 states having 45% of total senior shoppers.
- Spearheaded the creation of Collibra reports, KPIs, and metrics; onboarded and organized critical data tables, establishing data lineage for dashboards that boosted data governance practices.
- Built data engineering pipeline for 80+ features from different upstream data sources to provide training data for the customer persona classification model created by the client’s ML team.
- Performed Food SBU Level customer purchase trend Analysis for GLP consuming customer segment.
- Customer Segmentation: Led an advanced RFM-based customer segmentation model, enabling targeted offers that reduced order gaps and increased order value, resulting in a 16% GMV growth and improved retention of lapsed customers.
- Designed a LightGBM machine learning model to predict customer transitions between segments, achieving an accuracy of 70%.
#### Customer experience (Post Transaction)
- Perfect Order : Established a customer experience-driven metric that holistically captured end-to-end customer interactions; leveraged analytics to elevate customer satisfaction, reducing churn rate by 15% and
increasing perfect orders from 33% to 55%.
- Store Checkout Satisfaction: Analyzed survey and operational metrics to identify correlation between checkout satisfaction ratings and wait times, contributing to improvement in customer experience scores.
- Egregious Orders: Conducted detailed analysis of individual and combined pain points within post-transactional data, determining the threshold for each pain point below which the overall customer experience permanently deteriorates.
